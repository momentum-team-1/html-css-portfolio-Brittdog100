            According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a
            bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get
            its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies
            anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
            Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh,
            black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast
            is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? Barry? Adam? Can you
            believe this is happening? I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking
            sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.
            Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you,
            son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing
            going here. You got lint on your fuzz. Ow! That's me! Wave to us!
            We'll be in row 118,000. Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the
            house! Hey, Adam. Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel? A little. Special
            day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,
            three days high school. Those were awkward.
